Description
===========

This project improves the sash shell with two commands -echo
and -jsonast that evaluates arithmetic expressions and generates
the AST of the expressions as a json value.


C++ syntactic tree of arithmetic expressions.
=============================================

The classical erroneous cases of evaluation are:

* Divide by zero: It triggers an exception of type "divide_by_zero".
* Operator priority: 

Grammar
=======

Dependencies
============
- Jsoncpp
- Boost 1.54
  (notes: All libraries used are header-only
          Not tested with Boost version less than 1.54, it might work).

How to install Boost 
====================

The source files can be downloaded from: 

http://www.boost.org/users/download/

Once the compressed file is decompressed. The following commands should be
executed:

- ./bootstrap.sh
- ./b2 install

How to install jsoncpp

A version of jsoncpp that can be build with cmake is available at:

https://github.com/codebudo/jsoncpp

Then to install the library:

1. Install CMake in your system and make sure it is in your `$PATH` variable.
2. Open a new terminal an go to jsoncpp directory.
