Description
============================================

This project improves the sash shell with two commands -echo
and -jsonast that evaluates arithmetic expressions and generates
the AST of the expressions as a json value.


C++ syntactic tree of arithmetic expressions.
=============================================

The classical erroneous cases of evaluation are:

* Divide by zero: It triggers an exception of type "divide_by_zero".
* Operator priority: At the moment, the operator priority is not well-respected, the AST structure is not good and should be changed.

Dependencies
===========================
- Jsoncpp
- Boost.Variant (1.55)
- Boost.Spirit (1.55)

How to install Boost 
=============================================

The source files can be downloaded from: 

http://www.boost.org/users/download/

Once the compressed file is decompressed. The following commands should be
executed:

- ./bootstrap.sh
- ./b2 install

How to install jsoncpp
======================

A version of jsoncpp that can be build with cmake is available at:

https://github.com/codebudo/jsoncpp

Then to install the library:

1. Install CMake in your system and make sure it is in your `$PATH` variable.
2. Open a new terminal an go to jsoncpp directory.
3. `make`
4. `sudo make install`
