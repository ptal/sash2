C++ syntactic tree of arithmetic expressions.
=============================================

The classical erroneous cases of evaluation are:

* Divide by zero: It triggers an exception of type "divide_by_zero".
* Negative numbers: The representation doesn't allow the user to use negative numbers. However the result can be negative.
* Operator priority: Handle by the parser.

Dependencies
