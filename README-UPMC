The classical erroneous cases of evaluation are:

* Divide by zero: It triggers an exception of type "divide_by_zero".
* Operator priority: At the moment, the operator priority is not well-respected, the AST structure is not good and should be changed.

1. Install CMake in your system and make sure it is in your `$PATH` variable.
